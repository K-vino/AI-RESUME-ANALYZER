The "summary" field should be a short sentence describing the match. For example:
"The candidate has good experience and certifications, but their skills and education do not match well."

The "skills_match", "experience_match", "education_match", and "certifications_match" fields should be numbers between 0 and 100, representing the percentage match of each category.

For example, if the resume has 70% match in skills, the "skills_match" field should be 70. If the resume has no match in education, the "education_match" field should be 0.

You can assume that the resume and job description will be valid JSON objects, and that they will have the same fields as shown above.

You can use any language or library to solve this problem, but you must return a JSON object in the format described above.
